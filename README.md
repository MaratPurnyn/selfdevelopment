# selfdevelopment
For my personal development for future roles.

Task List

Implement ROAM
2DEngine
-angrybirds
-game where you occupy as much area as possible but converge together to defeat opponents.
-Simple AI
-sophisticated AI
-racing game with vehicles of difference masses ad terrain of varying friction

3Dgameengine
-gravity simulator

share data between processes using memory mapped file
-compute fractals with workers that can join and leave

use mathew godbolts compiler explorer to understand move semantics optimizations godbolt.org

WebSockets C++ client and insert it into an existing project to allow external command of a running application

Algorithms
-shortest route algorithm
--dijkstra, 
--a*
--floyd-warshall 
--figure out in which case you would chose which.
-fast fourier transform (for powers of 2) 
--apply convolution theory to convolve two sequences of  values. Test that the result is the same as the N^2 real-space operation. Time the two methods and plot out the n log(n) vs n^2 run times.

use perf to analyze hobby project to make it better
use  valgrind to analyze a hobby project and make it more correct
use -fsanitize to analyze a hobby project and make it more correct
figure out google benchmark to measure and optimize a function or part of code
create a program that outputs frames of a parametric function and generate a movie
form an opinion on Andrei Alexandrescu (watch cppcontalks, he's a smart dude)
when a segmentation fault occurs in your code, try to use gdb to get to the bottom of why it is happening. donï¿½t just rewrite it.

Find a random active open source project and submit a merge or pull request that improves performance, correctness or documentation.
